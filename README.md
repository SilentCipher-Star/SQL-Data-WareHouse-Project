# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

The materials of the data warehouse project: the source files, every script from the videos, and the docs.

You take raw files from two systems, a CRM and an ERP, and build one data warehouse in SQL Server. At the end, the data is clean and ready for analysis.

**New here? Open the setup guide in the `00_setup` folder.** It walks you through installing SQL Server and creating the database, on Windows and Mac, with the fixes for the common errors.
